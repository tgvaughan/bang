This is an example Bang! input file.
To see what it evaluates to, run "bang test.input -o -".

(Beware that this will produce errors unless you have all of the
interpreters invoked by the input file installed on your system.)

Now, onwards!

We can include Chicken scheme:
!!!csi -bq
(define (factorial n)
    (if (<= n 0)
        1
        (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))

(display (factorial 5))
!!!

Then perhaps some python:
!!!python3
for l in range(10):
    print("Hello, World {}!".format(l))
!!!

What now, maybe some R?
!!!FACT=R --slave -f

cat(factorial(5))
!!!

Or some bash!
!!!bash
echo $PATH
!!!

How about some inline evaluation? The square root of
2 to 5 decimal places is !!!dc -e "5 k 2 v p"!!!

(There is no need for the block to start at the beginning
of a line nor for it to end at the end of a line.)

Earlier result for factorial 5: FACT.

Finally, here is some guile scheme:

!!!guile -s
(display (reverse '(cow pig sheep)))!!!

That's pretty much it!
